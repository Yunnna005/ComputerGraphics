# Computer Graphics

## Overview
In this repository, I have implemented a series of features that demonstrate the principles of computer graphics. The main highlight of the project is the creation of a 3D letter model, which includes vertices, faces, normals, and textures. This serves as a foundation for understanding more complex graphics rendering techniques.
